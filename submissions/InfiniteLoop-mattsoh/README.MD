Just a Sprig project. Copy and paste the code onto sprig.hackclub.com (create a new project to play). 
Instructions are vague but remember Sprig only has controls WASD and IJKL (I think).
Your objective is to pass the two levels (yes, only two! what could go wrong...) by getting to the green goal in each level.
Get the best time! (And yes, there are no big bugs in the code and there are a few ways to reduce time).

Roughly 15.57 hours were spent. I worked alone.
