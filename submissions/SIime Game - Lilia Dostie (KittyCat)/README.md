# Slime Game

## Please note: This Game is unfinished. That said, it is still playable. See below for an explanation of the game concept and planned features

While I did run out of time to implement all the features I wanted to, I still wanted to explain those features so you can take them into consideration while judging my game.
First off, the lassers in the game were supposed to be climbable. However, since I ran out of time to do this, you'll fall off them if you try to climb them. But please note that they were intended to be climbable. Also, when you press the down arrow, s key, or shift while standing in front of a door, I wanted you to be able to go through it. Those are the two main features I ran out of time for.
Now here's the secret: When you go through any of the doors, the plan was to have it teleport the player back to the spawn position, thus trapping you in a loop. The only way out is to find the following loophole: There is a "sewer drain" hidden among the background decoration that when you stand in front of it and press the down arrow, s key, or shift, you beat the level!
